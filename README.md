# Babalaga
A BJS Galaga clone thingy


Just made in a day or two for fun.  Needs lots of updates to be considered a true clone, but most of the ground work is done.  Made all with 3d Sprites ripped from a 2d sheet.

TODOs
Re-enable Enemy bullets
Bonus Stages
Bonus Summary Screen
Sounds
Different Enemy Attack Patterns
The Last Remaining Enemy Srites and Behaviors 
Game Over Screen
Restart Game after Game Over
Over the top stuff like powerups not in the original game.
Screen Space Effects
Better Enemy attack Animations (Probably rotate the 3d sprite)
